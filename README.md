# Tunnel
This is Tunnel, a web tool for avoiding internet censorship. Tunnel has various links for proxies, links to privacy-focused alternatives to YouTube, and a command line, for more technical users. Tunnel can be used for getting around your internet restrictions, or unblocking websites at school.

No, you can not contribute to Tunnel, but you can suggest features to add/remove, report bugs or report unblocked links you may know.

This is meant to be a website, so if you want to fork this repository I would recommend using github pages, or if you don't want/need a website, download the `tunnel.html`.
