# Tunnel

User guide  
  

## about:blank Launcher

The about:blank launcher lets you open any link, without putting it in your search history.  
  
This will  **not**  unblock the link, it will simply just hide it from your search history.

### Link format

Every link must start with  `https://`, otherwise it will not work.  
  
For example, if you have the link  `coolmathgames.com`, type in  `**https://**coolmathgames.com`

## IDs

To open a proxy or Piped, simply input a number between  **0**  and the number listed in the number input.  
  
For example, the Piped input has the numbers  **0 - 9**, so input a number between  **0**  and  **9**.

### Why so many numbers?

Each number corresponds to a different link. If one of the links get blocked, there are many other links to choose from.

### What if a link doesn't work?

If a link doesn't work, the likeliest reason is that it just got blocked. It will be removed from the Tunnel shortly.
